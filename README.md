## Objectives
This project aims to train **one shared adapter + lightweight task-specific residual adapters + task-specific heads** for key developability properties relevant to enzymes, binders, synthetic biology, and related protein engineering tasks.

- [ ] Repeat training to build ensembles and evaluate ensembling strategies.

### Ideas To Consider
- Per-task pooling
- Mixture-of-experts style light specialization
- Train a few different variants with different seeds
- Possibly add ESM-MSA optional embeddings
- Possibly test out these properties added as additional features:
  - Add MW, pI, net charge, charge density.
  - Aromaticity, aliphatic index
  - Low-complexity / entropy and disorder-related residue fractions.
- Generate embeddings for each protein

### Properties (Primary)
- [X] Thermal unfolding metrics (Tm, ΔG)
- [ ] Stability under pH or ionic strength shifts
- [X] Aggregation propensity
- [X] Solubility
- [ ] Secretion signal / signal peptide presence
- [ ] Immunogenicity / epitope likelihood
- [ ] Oligomerization state / assembly propensity
- [ ] Metal binding / cofactor dependence

## Properties (Secondary)
Properties for future investigation (lower priority and potentially less synergistic with the primary set).
- Binding affinity (protein–protein, protein–ligand)
- Enzymatic activity (kcat, Km, specificity)
- Expression yield / solubility in specific hosts
- Subcellular localization
- Allosteric regulation potential
- Disorder content / intrinsically disordered regions
- PTM site likelihood (phosphorylation, glycosylation, ubiquitination, acetylation)

> I suggest we ignore these for the time being, as they all require some degree of auxiliary information. For example, binding affinity depends on interaction partners, while enzymatic activity and kcat are only meaningful with substrate information. Without this context, I'm of the opinion that these properties would be of limited value. That said, I’ve kept them listed to provide a sense of future direction for the project, once the initial set of primary properties has been implemented.

## Motivation
The current ecosystem provides many task-specific models for properties such as solubility and stability, but few efforts unify these objectives within a single, structure-aware model. A multi-property framework can reduce parameter count and improve throughput, while potentially improving accuracy through shared signal across correlated biochemical traits (e.g., stability-related metrics).

Additionally, widely used tools (e.g., NetSolP-1.0) rely on older base models and datasets. With improved architectures, larger corpora, and better training algorithms now available, a modern, multi-property, structure-aware approach is both timely and high-impact.

## Taining
1. Once the above data downloads have been complete, run the dta aggregation pipeline.
```sh
python aggregate_data.py
```
2. Tokenize the aggregated data so that it is ready for training
```sh
python tokenize_data.py
```
3. Train the models, currently suggest using L40S GPU(s)
```sh
python train.py
```

## Inference
Download the Hugging Face ProstT5 assets without running prediction:
```sh
python inference.py --download-weights
```

When `--checkpoint` is omitted, inference defaults to `checkpoints/prostt5_multitask_adapter_best_2026-05-27_seed_1.pt`.

## Results
### Version 2026-04-26
- Increased task-head capacity beyond the original `LayerNorm + Linear` design by introducing small MLP heads, with the main goal of improving regression calibration and expressiveness.
- Removed `temperature_stability_abs` from the shared multitask setup because it was a small, single-protein dataset that was unlikely to contribute useful transferable signal.
- Added richer validation for classification tasks, including `AUROC` and `AUPRC`, to separate ranking quality from thresholded classification quality.
- Added post-hoc threshold tuning for binary classification tasks to test whether task-specific decision thresholds could improve `acc`, `balanced_acc`, `precision`, `recall`, and `F1`.
- Added post-hoc linear calibration for regression tasks using `y_calibrated = a * y_pred + b` to correct prediction bias and under-dispersion without retraining.
- Result: the architectural head changes were a clear improvement overall, while the post-hoc calibration steps produced modest but informative gains, especially for some regression tasks.

### Version 2026-04-28
- Tested a new regression-loss recipe intended to better align strong ranking performance with stronger numeric accuracy.
- Replaced plain `MSE` / `L1` regression loss with Huber loss to make training more robust to noisy or outlier-heavy biological measurements.
- Added a pairwise ranking term to the regression objective:
  `loss = mse_or_huber + lambda * pairwise_ranking_loss`
- The goal was to preserve and strengthen relative ordering, since Spearman correlation was already reasonably strong on several tasks.
- Result: this experiment did not improve the main validation metrics. Overall performance was slightly worse across both classification and regression, so this direction was not retained.

### Version 2026-04-29
- Introduced a shared adapter plus small per-task residual adapters so each task can specialize the shared representation without giving up multitask sharing.
- Moved from one fully shared pooled representation to task-specific token adaptation before pooling, allowing each task to derive its own sequence summary from a common adapted backbone.
- This change was intended to improve task-specific calibration and feature specialization while keeping the parameter increase modest.
- Result: this was the strongest run so far. The main gains came from the regression tasks, with substantial improvements in both error (`MAE` / `RMSE`) and ranking quality (`Spearman`), while classification performance remained broadly stable.
- Post-hoc calibration continued to show additional upside for some regression tasks, especially `folding_stability`, suggesting the learned representation is strong and remaining gains may come from better final calibration rather than major architectural changes.

### Version 2026-04-30
- Added learned uncertainty weighting so each task contributed through a trainable per-task uncertainty term rather than fixed equal weighting.
- This changed the multitask balance but did not clearly improve the overall result.
- `aggregation_propensity` and `temperature_stability` improved, but `expression_yield` and `folding_stability` both regressed, making the net effect mixed to slightly worse overall.

### Version 2026-05-22
- Added optional evolutionary-alignment training support for `folding_stability` using precomputed homolog/MSA-derived residue likelihood targets.
- This feature was inspired by the preprint at `https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.04.25.650688v4`.
- This introduced a target-building script, tokenization/cache support for per-residue alignment supervision, and a residue-likelihood head with an auxiliary correlation-based loss.
- The auxiliary loss is disabled by default through `LAMBDA_EVOLUTIONARY_ALIGNMENT = 0.0`, so this version mainly adds the training pathway and data plumbing rather than changing baseline behavior on its own.
- Compared with the previous best run (`2026-04-29`), this checkpoint looked roughly flat overall: classification moved slightly, ranking metrics were modestly stronger, and uncalibrated `folding_stability` regression was worse (`MAE 0.6435` vs `0.6260`) even though Spearman improved (`0.8440` vs `0.8373`).
- The calibrated `folding_stability` MAE improved from `0.4853` to `0.4725`, an absolute gain of `0.0128` or about `2.6%`, but that effect is small and not cleanly apples-to-apples because older runs used validation-time post-hoc fitting while this checkpoint uses saved checkpoint calibration.
- Practical takeaway: the measured `folding_stability` gain is modest enough that it may be within normal seed-to-seed variance, so this version does not yet make a strong case for keeping the evolutionary-alignment pathway on performance grounds alone.

##### Test Split
Not reported here because this version was developed under an earlier experimental setup, and the current checkpoint/seed conventions no longer map cleanly onto that stage of the project. Re-evaluating it on the present test pipeline could therefore be ambiguous and potentially misleading.

#### 4 Checkpoint Ensemble
- Evaluated a simple four-checkpoint prediction ensemble built from the strongest recent seeds and the older mixed-seed checkpoint.
- Result: the ensemble was competitive, but it did **not** clearly beat the best single-checkpoint runs overall.
- Classification moved only slightly and remained roughly within normal run-to-run variation.
- Regression was mixed: the ensemble was solid, but it generally did not surpass the strongest single-seed checkpoints on the tasks that mattered most, especially when comparing against the best raw `Spearman` / `MAE` results from `aggregation_propensity`, `expression_yield`, and `folding_stability`.
- Practical takeaway: ensembling did not provide a compelling enough gain to justify treating it as the default evaluation or deployment path, so the best single-checkpoint models remain the more meaningful reference point.

### Naive One-Hot Linear Baseline
Sanity-check baseline using fixed one-hot amino-acid sequence encodings with simple linear models rather than pretrained protein language model features. Binary tasks were evaluated with logistic regression and continuous tasks with ridge regression to estimate how much performance can be recovered from shallow linear sequence representations alone.
